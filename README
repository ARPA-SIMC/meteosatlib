 C++ source code to read Meteosat Images in various formats.

 This libraries are used to read Meteosat files on a PDUS
 receiving station. No decryption is performed. Files are expected
 to be already decrypted by using the EUMETSAT key unit, or to be
 transitted already in clear form.
 For MSG data decompression, You need the EUMETSAT source code for
 the decompression library for Wavelet, JPEG and T4 images.
 Please fill the form at

   http://oiswww.eumetsat.int/WEBOPS-cgi/wavelet/register

 to obtain the source code and put the PublicDecompWT.zip file under
 the directory "decompress".

 Some example program need NetCDF library and ImageMagick.

 Use at Your own risk and for any purposes.
 Feel free to contact me for any help-bug found.

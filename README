 * About

This is a set of libraries, tools and GDAL plugins to read and write Meteosat
images in several formats.

There are low-level functions to work with: HRIT/LRIT, HRI, OpenMTP, and
OpenMTP-IDS.

The GDAL driver can work with xRIT, SAF HDF5, two NetCDF dialects, GRIB.

Use at Your own risk and for any purposes.

See AUTHORS file for contact information.

See http://sourceforge.net/p/meteosatlib/wiki/Home/ for more examples and
troubleshooting.


 * **IMPORTANT** HRIT support

This library is used to read Meteosat files on a PDUS receiving station. No
decryption is performed. Files are expected to be already decrypted by using
the EUMETSAT key unit, or to be transitted already in clear form.

For MSG data decompression, You need the EUMETSAT source code for the
decompression library for Wavelet, JPEG and T4 images.

Please fill the form at http://oiswww.eumetsat.int/WEBOPS-cgi/wavelet/register
to obtain the source code and put the PublicDecompWT.zip file under
the directory "decompress".


 * Package contents

decompress/  put PublicDecompWT.zip here. The directory contains scripts and
             patches to convince it to build.

msat/        the low-level meteosatlib library. It contains functions to
             directly access all supported formats.

gdal/        the GDAL plugin sources, which implement GDAL drivers using the
             low-level meteosatlib library.

tests/       unit tests.

tools/       command line tools using the library.

examples/    example code using the low-level libraries and the GDAL plugin.

Release 0.5  : (22/11/2006)

  * Enrico Zini, Wed Nov 22, 2006

  - Added the msat library, that implements a satellite image abstraction
    independent from the encoding format.  Msat features include:
     - importers and exporter for anything that is supported by meteosatlib,
       allowing conversions to/from any of them.
     - georeferentiation of image data
     - extracting subareas both in pixels and in coordinates
     - export to any image format supported by Magick++
     - preview of the cropping results directly on X11
     - commandline tool 'msat' to take advantage of these functions
     - supports reprojection
  - Imports large GRIB files
  - Imports SAF images
  - Added support for grib-style NetCDF24 image format.
  - Imports HRIT HRV files, with correct placement of the two sub-images they
    contain
  - Compiles and tests fine on amd64

Release 0.4.1  : (03/01/2006)

  * Graziano Giuliani, Tue Jan  3 2006

  - Small bugs corrected. Compiles with g++ 4.0

Release 0.4.0  : (23/08/2005)

  * Graziano Giuliani, Tue Aug 23 2005

  - New interface added for MSG Native format from U-MARF
  - New interface added for Tyco ThornSDS DB1 RAW file format
  - Corrected small bugs in HRIT interface

Release 0.3.6  : (10/08/2005)

  * Deneys S. Maartens, Mon Aug  8 2005

  The following changes have been made to meteosatlib-0.3.5:

  - Change of directory structure layout
  - Implementation of non-recursive make
  - Minor changes to source files to get everything to compile
  - Rewrite of configure.ac, Makefile.am and meteosatlib.spec
  - Minor changes to PublicDecompWT.sh


  Change of directory structure layout:
  -------------------------------------

  In meteosatlib-0.3.5 the directory structure is as follows:

      meteosatlib-0.3.5/
      |-- config
      |-- examples
      |-- specs
      `-- src
          |-- decompress
          |-- hri
          |-- hrit
          |-- msg-native
          |-- omtp-ids
          `-- openmtp

  The source directories have moved from the src/ directory to the top
  level directory, and (almost) every source directory have an examples/
  subdirectory, where examples pertaining to the particular library lives.
  The structure now looks like:

      meteosatlib-0.3.6/
      |-- config
      |-- decompress
      |-- examples
      |-- grib
      |-- hri
      |   `-- examples
      |-- hrit
      |   `-- examples
      |-- msg-native
      |-- omtp-ids
      |   `-- examples
      `-- openmtp
          `-- examples

  While was reordering the directories I noticed that some examples do not
  pertain to a particular library, and that some files are required for
  more than one library's examples.  The non-library specific files were
  left in the examples directory, while the source files needed for more
  than one library's examples were moved to the grib directory.

  I would assume, as the msg-native library is developed, it would get an
  examples/ subdirectory too.


  Implementation of non-recursive make:
  -------------------------------------

  In the article "Recursive Make Considered Harmful"
  (http://www.pcug.org.au/~millerp/rmch/recu-make-cons-harm.html) various
  reasons are explored why recursive make is not desirable.  I have
  re-implemented the make rules to be non-recursive.  This makes use of an
  Automake.rules file in each subdirectory, which is included in the top
  level Makefile.am file.

  Each of the Automake.rules file in each of the subdirectories contain
  information on the rules required to make the various files in the
  relevant subdirectory.

  A number of command line options were added to the configure script:

      --disable-hri           disable hri support
      --disable-hrit          disable hrit support
      --disable-msg-native    disable msg-native support
      --disable-omtp-ids      disable omtp-ids support
      --disable-openmtp       disable openmtp support

  These options can disable the building of a particular library.  During
  the tests performed in the configure script the availability of various
  header files and libraries are checked.  These libraries are required to
  build one or more of the components of the meteosatlib library.  If a
  required header or library is not found, the building of that specific
  library is disabled.

  When the configure script ends a summary is displayed, showing which
  support is build in, and which not.  The example below shows that all
  libraries will be built:

      ===================================================
      meteosatlib-0.3.6 configuration:
        hri:                    yes
        hrit:                   yes
        msg-native:             yes
        omtp-ids:               yes
        openmtp:                yes
      ===================================================

  The specific libraries that will be build dictates which Automake.rules
  files in the various sub-directories will be included in the top level
  Makefile.am.


  Minor changes to source files to get everything to compile:
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  In order to get everything to compile cleanly, minor changes were
  required to various source files.  These changes were the inclusion of
  the library header directory, as found under the include directory.  The
  file include.patch contains these modifications.


  Rewrite of configure.ac, Makefile.am and meteosatlib.spec:
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  The configure.ac file, the meteosatlib.spec file and various Makefile.am
  and Automake.rules files were created or rewritten to enable
  non-recursive make, and the enable/disable of building some components
  of the meteosatlib libraries.

  The following RPM are built:

      meteosatlib-0.3.6-1.nosrc.rpm
      meteosatlib-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
      meteosatlib-hri-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
      meteosatlib-hrit-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
      meteosatlib-msg-native-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
      meteosatlib-omtp-ids-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
      meteosatlib-openmtp-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm

  The source RPM is .nosrc.rpm because the PublicDecompWT.zip file is
  listed as a source file, but is not included in the source RPM.


  Minor changes to PublicDecompWT.sh:
  -----------------------------------

  Two changes to PublicDecompWT.sh were made.  The invoking of unzip was
  changed to add the -a flag, as the dos2unix utilities on my local
  machine seems to have some bugs.  The -a flag does CR/LF translation on
  ASCII files as the files are unpacked.

  The other change was to create a pdwt.patched file when the source is
  patched.  This avoids the attempts to apply the patch to the EUMETSAT
  source after it has already been applied.

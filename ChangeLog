	* Version 0.3.6

The following changes have been made to meteosatlib-0.3.5:

- Change of directory structure layout
- Implementation of non-recursive make
- Minor changes to source files to get everything to compile
- Rewrite of configure.ac, Makefile.am and meteosatlib.spec
- Minor changes to PublicDecompWT.sh


Change of directory structure layout:
-------------------------------------

In meteosatlib-0.3.5 the directory structure is as follows:

	meteosatlib-0.3.5/
	|-- config
	|-- examples
	|-- specs
	`-- src
	    |-- decompress
	    |-- hri
	    |-- hrit
	    |-- msg-native
	    |-- omtp-ids
	    `-- openmtp

The source directories have moved from the src/ directory to the top
level directory, and (almost) every source directory have an examples/
subdirectory, where examples pertaining to the particular library lives.
The structure now looks like:

	meteosatlib-0.3.6/
	|-- config
	|-- decompress
	|-- examples
	|-- grib
	|-- hri
	|   `-- examples
	|-- hrit
	|   `-- examples
	|-- msg-native
	|-- omtp-ids
	|   `-- examples
	`-- openmtp
	    `-- examples

While was reordering the directories I noticed that some examples do not
pertain to a particular library, and that some files are required for
more than one library's examples.  The non-library specific files were
left in the examples directory, while the source files needed for more
than one library's examples were moved to the grib directory.

I would assume, as the msg-native library is developed, it would get an
examples/ subdirectory too.


Implementation of non-recursive make:
-------------------------------------

In the article "Recursive Make Considered Harmful"
(http://www.pcug.org.au/~millerp/rmch/recu-make-cons-harm.html) various
reasons are explored why recursive make is not desirable.  I have
re-implemented the make rules to be non-recursive.  This makes use of an
Automake.rules file in each subdirectory, which is included in the top
level Makefile.am file.

Each of the Automake.rules file in each of the subdirectories contain
information on the rules required to make the various files in the
relevant subdirectory.

A number of command line options were added to the configure script:

	--disable-hri           disable hri support
	--disable-hrit          disable hrit support
	--disable-msg-native    disable msg-native support
	--disable-omtp-ids      disable omtp-ids support
	--disable-openmtp       disable openmtp support

These options can disable the building of a particular library.  During
the tests performed in the configure script the availability of various
header files and libraries are checked.  These libraries are required to
build one or more of the components of the meteosatlib library.  If a
required header or library is not found, the building of that specific
library is disabled.

When the configure script ends a summary is displayed, showing which
support is build in, and which not.  The example below shows that all
libraries will be built:

	===================================================
	meteosatlib-0.3.6 configuration:
	hri:                    yes
	hrit:                   yes
	msg-native:             yes
	omtp-ids:               yes
	openmtp:                yes
	===================================================

The specific libraries that will be build dictates which Automake.rules
files in the various sub-directories will be included in the top level
Makefile.am.


Minor changes to source files to get everything to compile:
-----------------------------------------------------------

In order to get everything to compile cleanly, minor changes were
required to various source files.  These changes were the inclusion of
the library header directory, as found under the include directory.  The
file include.patch contains these modifications.


Rewrite of configure.ac, Makefile.am and meteosatlib.spec:
----------------------------------------------------------

The configure.ac file, the meteosatlib.spec file and various Makefile.am
and Automake.rules files were created or rewritten to enable
non-recursive make, and the enable/disable of building some components
of the meteosatlib libraries.

The following RPM are built:

	meteosatlib-0.3.6-1.nosrc.rpm
	meteosatlib-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
	meteosatlib-hri-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
	meteosatlib-hrit-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
	meteosatlib-msg-native-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
	meteosatlib-omtp-ids-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
	meteosatlib-openmtp-devel-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm

The source RPM is .nosrc.rpm because the PublicDecompWT.zip file is
listed as a source file, but is not included in the source RPM.


Minor changes to PublicDecompWT.sh:
-----------------------------------

Two changes to PublicDecompWT.sh were made.  The invoking of unzip was
changed to add the -a flag, as the dos2unix utilities on my local
machine seems to have some bugs.  The -a flag does CR/LF translation on
ASCII files as the files are unpacked.

The other change was to create a pdwt.patched file when the source is
patched.  This avoids the attempts to apply the patch to the EUMETSAT
source after it has already been applied.
